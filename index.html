		<h1> C'mon in!</h1>
		<h3> I'm a Digital Project Manager based in Nottingham, in the United Kingdom. I started started writing code to help fellow colleagues out during busy periods at work. What started off as bug-fixing on emails and landing pages and solution testing has resulted in an obsession with code and how websites are built. My aim is to build exceptional, high-quality websites and applications by end of 2020.</h3>

		<img src="me.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
		<h3>I've always been interested in technology and computers and attended a school focussed on IT and with links to major Japanese companies including Toshiba. At university I studied Business Management and graduated with a 2.1, and over the last 6 years I've delivered a variety of digital projects from web applications, custom systems (think events systems, CRMs etc.), e-commerce websites and e-shots. Consquently, I've come to develop a deep appreciation for the software development process, technologies and the importance of user-experience design in digital solutions. To further enhance my skills I'm aiming to master the following languages by the end of the year. </b> </h3>
